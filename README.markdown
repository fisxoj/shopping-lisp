# Shopping-Lisp - Lisp reimplementation of the backend of the android shopping list app.

For fun, a lisp equivalent to [GroundApps/ShoppingList_Backend](https://github.com/GroundApps/ShoppingList_Backend) which serves as the backend for [this app](https://github.com/GroundApps/ShoppingList).

## Usage
```lisp
(ql:quickload :shopping-lisp)
(shopping-lisp:run)
```

## Installation
I think I'm going to work on a Docker image at some point, for now it's just a standard lisp package.
